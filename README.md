Repository for Jessica's portfolio site

This is a gallery based portfolio site that i purchased commercial licensing for from dynamic-gallery.net 
(now flash-gallery.net) and am reworking to support my girlfriend's graphic design portfolio.

Target goals include:
1) Clean up a bunch of the garbage in the code
2) Scrap json sub galleries with jquery xml import to gallery-items (xml will make changing content much easier)
3) Establish long term gallery categories
4) Optimize loading times
5) Create a better means of showing detailed description related to the displayed image
6) Change links to not be related to original designer 
7) Implement new analytics code
8) Re-familiarize myself with site design (it has been quite a few years)
